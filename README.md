# USCProdML
Teaching aid for 30 Oct 2020 Production ML Seminar

## Background information:

There are a lot of ways to deploy and scale ML applications today (this is both a good and bad thing) but since it's all changing at breakneck pace, maybe school hasn't caught up yet. So I want to show you a bit about the deployment paradigms that exist and give you a taste for where you might want to invest more time as you continue your ML/DS/AI Journey.

This repo current covers Part 1 of the workshop
